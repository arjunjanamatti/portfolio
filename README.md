## Projects

### Single Echelon Inventory Optimization
**Summary:** Optimized safety stock calculations using feedback learning, resulting in a reduction of 100 ME in the first year across 90% of factories and distribution centers.

**Requirement:** Previous safety stock calculations assumed normally distributed demand and no variation in lead time, leading to frequent stock outs.

**Solution:** Calculated optimal safety stock, right-sizing it for 80 distribution centers and 120 factories. Implemented a feedback loop to understand and learn from changes in safety stock recommendations.

**Approach:** Used convolution of demand series over lead time series with a joint probability approach.

**Inputs and Deployment:** Processed sales and purchase order data for approximately 1.3 million unique plant-material combinations, deployed in AWS with parallel processing in batch jobs.

**Techniques:**
- 📊 Joint probabilities
- 🔄 Convolution of distribution objects

**Tools:** Python, AWS, Tableau, numpy, pandas, scipy, math, pygad

### Multi Echelon Inventory Optimization
**Summary:** Enhanced the single echelon solution using network modeling and a genetic algorithm optimizer.

**Requirement:** The single echelon approach only considered individual DCs or factories, without simulating SLA scenarios.

**Solution:** Enabled planners to simulate scenarios, maintaining regional SLA even when upstream SLAs were not met.

**Approach:** Used a genetic algorithm to simulate scenarios and optimize safety stock with the objective of minimizing stock levels.

**Techniques:**
- 📊 Joint probabilities
- 🔄 Convolution of distribution objects
- 🧬 Genetic algorithm

**Tools:** Python, AWS, Tableau, numpy, pandas, scipy, math, pygad

### Demand Forecasting
**Summary:** Improved demand forecasting accuracy by 5-10% using statistical approaches, regression models, DL models, and logical reasoning.

**Requirement:** Existing forecasting methods in Kinaxis achieved only 35% accuracy, necessitating improvement.

**Solution:** Applied the developed solution across all business units, significantly improving accuracy and reducing variance from actuals.

**Approach:** Treated outliers, clustered time series, and used an ensemble of models for demand forecasting.

**Techniques:**
- 📊 Time series modeling
- 🗂️ Hierarchical clustering
- 🚫 Outlier treatment

**Tools:** Python, AWS, Tableau, numpy, pandas, scipy, math, darts, scikit-learn, tsfresh

### Production Planning
**Summary:** Optimized manual production planning processes using ML-based optimizers to fully utilize available resources.

**Requirement:** Planners needed to optimize production plans considering inventory and arriving stock, aiming for optimal resource utilization.

**Solution:** Developed an ML-based optimization for production end dates, considering constraints like capacity, queue, priority, efficiency, and material availability.

**Approach:** Used MIP to identify manufacturable orders and a genetic algorithm to optimize production line utilization and order completion times.

**Techniques:**
- 📊 Mixed integer linear programming
- 🧬 Genetic algorithm

**Tools:** Python, AWS, numpy, pandas, scipy, math, pygad

### Video and Audio Classification
**Summary:** Built a Flask API for reviewing videos uploaded to a mobile app, identifying and flagging foul language and images using ML.

**Requirement:** The mobile app required ML to detect foul images or language in uploaded videos.

**Solution:** Developed a solution to identify acceptable videos, with flagged content reviewed by an administrator.

**Approach:** Used deepspeech for audio-to-text conversion and OpenCV for video detection.

**Techniques:**
- 🎥 OpenCV for computer vision
- 🎧 Deepspeech for audio
- 📝 Spacy for NLP

**Tools:** Python, AWS, Tableau, numpy, pandas, scipy, math, OpenCV, tensorflow, deepspeech

### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Projects

#### RAG_1
**Summary:** Developed a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system to enhance information retrieval and generation capabilities.

**Repository:** RAG_1

**Approach:** Implemented a pipeline to populate a database and retrieve relevant information using advanced NLP techniques.

**Tools:** Python, various NLP libraries

#### RAG_local
**Summary:** Built a local RAG system to ensure data privacy and reduce token costs, enabling efficient information retrieval and generation on local machines.

**Repository:** RAG_local

**Approach:** Set up a local RAG pipeline using open-source tools to process and retrieve information from local data sources.

**Tools:** Python, local deployment tools
